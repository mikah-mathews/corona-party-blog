# Hewwo UwU
My name is Mikah and I am a 19 year old non-binary person living in Seattle.  
I __really__ like my boyfriend and my pet dog.

> I could die. My mom could die. They will not waste life saving medical equipment on us.  
> I don't want to die anymore.  

# ANYWAY  
Here is a list of things that I do in my freetime.  
* Read
* Play or go on walks with my dog
* Chat with my boyfriend
* Contemplate my mortality
* Bake bread while ignoring my increasing anxiety
* Take showers 
* Ignore the dread
* ### Ignore it
* Sing songs
